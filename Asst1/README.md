> It's easy to understand that wired channel has better bandwidth due to the worse noisy for wirless signal as well as the multiple user for icampus WIFI.

## Throughput comparsion case: buffer length

**Throughput over time**
![alt text](image-7.png)

> Analysisï¼š With respect to speedtest2 and speedtest3, the difference is caused by the data traffic of there two data center. We can find the data traffic at https://speedtest2.serverius.net/. Then we can notice data center3 has havier traffic which maight cause the smaller bandwidth during my test. With repect to **Uztelecom**, the very small bandwidth might be raised by some router nodes in in the path even though these three servers have the same claimed bandwidth. Epecially, we can use **Tracert** to test the router along the path. The result implies there might be some bottleneck in the path.

**Throughput change over time**

>analysis:Smaller buffers increase system overhead and cause throughput fluctuations, while larger buffers reduce system calls, improving throughput stability and efficiency, especially in high-bandwidth networks.

## About goodput
**Assumption:**
* Every time TCP send the longest packet in the ethernet.
* The transfer data in Iperf includes the cost of all network layer

Let's take:
* Ethernet header cost: 14 Bytes
* IP header cost(IPv4): 20 Bytes
* TCP header cost:      20 Bytes
Ethernet longest frame: 1500 Bytes.

TCP useful data=1500-20-20=1460Bytes,

To send 1460 Bytes, we need 14+1500=1514Bytes data.

In other words, the percentage of good put=1460/1514=96.4%

Consider the throuput and goodput over different interface

>Analysis: Here we just rougly calculate the goodput. If we want to have a more precise number, we need to known more details about the packet.

Here we plot the delay under different interface.
Here I only plot the delay from server to client.

>analysis: These two cards both can access to ethernet and the link speed both can reach the l000Mbps. But they have different delay performace. Apart from the testing time(few minutes difference), I guess the most important reason is the process speed of these two hardware(Ugreen is much more expensive than LRealtek card.)
